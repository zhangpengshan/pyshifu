# pyshifu
pyshifu is a Python module for machine learning build on top of java version shifu, which provided large scalability of
build high accuracy models with TB level data set in hours.          

More details about shifu, visit shifu's wiki page: https://github.com/shifuml/shifu/wiki

pyshifu provided the basic operations in the pipeline above, such as new, init, stats...        


## Installation   
### Dependencies   
shifu requires:     
 * Python(>=2.7 or >=3.3)   
 * Java(>=7.0)   

Shifu Optional:   
 * Hadoop   
 
 
Platform requirement:   
 * Mac    
 * Linux     
 * Windows(>=10586.1007)
As pyshifu currently depended on bash script to set environment, so windows without shell support could not work correctly.
In the future, we will remove all shell script.


### User installation
The easiest way to install pyshifu is using pip:     
```bazaar
pip install pyshifu
```
or use conda:         
```bazaar
conda install pyshifu
```
